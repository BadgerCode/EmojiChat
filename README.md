# Developer Guide
## Setup for local development
Clone this repository.<br>
The folder [emojichat](/emojichat) should go in your Garry's Mod addons folder.

I would recommend setting up a symbolic link `garrysmod/addons/emojichat-lua` -> `emojichat-repository/emojichat`.


## HTML Chatbox Component
* The files for this can be found in the `emojichat-html` directory
* For the HTML chatbox, see the [README](/emojichat-html/README.md) in `emojichat-html`
* Old commits can be found [here](https://github.com/BadgerCode/emojichat-html)
